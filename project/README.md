# Project Idea

## 1. **Legal/Medical/Niche QA Bot**

* **What**: Build a question-answering system over legal contracts, scientific articles, or educational materials.
* **Tools**: LangChain, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector stores (FAISS/Chroma).
* **Add-on**: Use Pinecone or Weaviate for scalable retrieval.


## 2. **Tiny LLM from Scratch**

* **What**: Implement a GPT-style transformer model from scratch (e.g., nanoGPT).
* **Goal**: Understand attention, positional encoding, and optimization deeply.
* **Skills**: PyTorch, Transformer architecture, training loops.
